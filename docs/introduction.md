# Introduction

The microcontroller is equivalent to the brain of the robot. The various sensors installed on robots are their eyes, noses, mouths, ears and so on. This sensor kit includes digital and analog sensors, modules such as ultrasound, digital tubes, temperature and humidity sensor.

## **Kit Contents**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| White LED | Basic LED module for beginners |
| RGB LED | Multi-color LED module |
| Temperature Sensor | Analog temperature measurement |
| Ultrasonic Sensor | Distance measurement (2-40cm) |
| PIR Motion Sensor | Motion detection module |

## **Compatibility**

All sample codes are based on **Arduino**. You can also use this kit with other development platforms:
- 51 microcontroller
- STM32
- Raspberry Pi  
- micro:bit

> **Note:** The port "-, +, S" on sensors correspond to "G, V, S" due to edition changes.
